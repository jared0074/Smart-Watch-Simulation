# Smart-Watch-Simulation
Smart Watch Simulation using Java with Real Time Concepts

The Smart Watch Simulation involves 2 sensors and 1 notificaton.
The project is a simulation that handles regular interval task and asynchronized tasks using real time concepts
There will be 16 versions of the code (each applied with different concurrency concepts) to measure performance in a real time perspective

Files included:
1. Code files (16 Versions)
2. Research and Documentation on Real Time System performance of the purposed simulation
